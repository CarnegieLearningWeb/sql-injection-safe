# Annotation for SQL Injection Safe Parameters and fields, and Util for Sql-Injection-Safe check

Through this library you get an annotation SQLInjectionSafe for validating if field-values or parameter-values are SQL-Injection safe

This Library has been thoroughly tested with various sql-injection-embedded data samples.

To use this, include this dependency in your pom.xml

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.github.rkpunjal.sqlsafe</groupId>
            <artifactId>sql-injection-safe</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0</version>
        </dependency>

A usage could look something like this
`private @SQLInjectionSafe String id;`

or you can also use the utility method 
'SqlSafeUtil.isSqlInjectionSafe("my-string-value")'


For a Detailed Explanation on how this library works, refer to my article here: 
https://dzone.com/articles/custom-annotation-in-java-for-sql-injection-safe-p

It's the same code that has been slightly enhanced and modified so that now you have the annotation directly for your own use.


You can also this used it in a spring mvc controller to validate the incoming request parameter.

Spring MVC has itâ€™s own way of running validators on RequestParameters.
Hence you have to first create a wrapper class annotate your parameter.

eg:
public static class IdWrapper{
    private @SQLInjectionSafe String id;
    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }
    public void setId(String id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
}

Then you can use the wrapper in your controller like this:

@RequestMapping(value = "/getById)
public MyResponseObject getById(
        @Valid @ModelAttribute() IdWrapper idWrapper){
// do your stuff
}

Refer to these links to understand in detail why you need to create a wrapper class for the parametes.
